      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Engine! The Movie Recommendation Engine is a recommender system that uses 
        collaborative filtering to make predictions on user preferences. It takes the users who have liked similar movies 
        combined with the movies that have been rated similarly to each other by users to learn the relationship between users and movies 
        using machine learning algorithms. It then provides you an intelligent prediction on the best movies curated for you. 
        <br><br>
        We applied the Recommendation Engines to a dataset of movies to demonstrate how they work, however these engines can be easily applied
        to any dataset of users and items such as e-commerce sales, social media likes and website activity for advertising 
        to provide intelligent recommendations
        <br><br>
        The Movie Recommendation Engine was trainedusing the <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">Group Lens Small Dataset</a>.
        it uses a public dataset of 100,000 real movie ratings by users. 
        <br><br>
        All of the source code for the system is available in the following github repos:

      <h2>Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD)</h2>
      <p>The SVD Recommendation Engine Model uses the SVD algorithm as popularized by <a href="https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html">Simon Funk during the Netflix Prize</a>
        . The model was built using the <a href="https://surpriselib.com/">Surprise Python Library</a>. 
        It learns a set of latent features for each movie and user and converges onto their values using gradient descent. 
        See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3RKsY2H-NE">Youtube Video about Collaborative Filtering</a> for a short explanation of how it works.
        <br><br>
        The adjustable parameters for SVD are: </p>
        <h3>Number of Factors:</h3>
        <p>The number of factors is the number of latent features the model learns.</p>
        <h3>Number of Epochs:</h3>
        <p>The number of epochs is the number of iterations of the SGD procedure we use when training the model.</p>
        <h3>Popularity Boost:</h3>
        <p>
        This is an inverse boost value that provides a boost to the more popular movies. 
        The boost is the logarithm base of the number of ratings which is then multiplied by the score to boost popularity.
        Use a popularity boost of 1 for no boosting and 2 for the highest boost. The boosting decreases as 
        you increase this value above 2. A popularity boost of 10 means that a movie that is 10 times more popular than another 
        movie will have their score multiplied by a factor of 2.

      <h2>User Based K-Nearest Neighbors</h2>
      <p>The User Based KNN Model is a straightforward K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that I have written an implementation for from scratch.
        It works by taking the K Nearest Neighbors to determine the most similar users to you based on the euclidian distance of your 
        prediction vector. It then takes a distance-weighted mean of their rated movies to determine a predicted rating.
        <br><br>
        The adjustable parameters for SVD are: </p>
        <h3>Number of Neighbors:</h3>
        <p>The number of most similar users to consider.</p>
        <h3>Minimum Support:</h3>
      <p>The minimum number of matching movies a user has to have rated in order to be considered as a neighbor. 
        The actual minimum support value is taken to be the minimum of the number of movies rated and the supplied minimum support value.
        If there are no users that match the minimum support condition, we simply return the default recommendations.
      </p>
        <h3>Popularity Boost:</h3>
        <p>
        This is an inverse boost value that provides a boost to the more popular movies. 
        The boost is the logarithm base of the number of ratings which is then multiplied by the score to boost popularity.
        Use a popularity boost of 1 for no boosting and 2 for the highest boost. The boosting decreases as 
        you increase this value above 2. A popularity boost of 10 means that a movie that is 10 times more popular than another 
        movie will have their score multiplied by a factor of 2.

      <h2>Default Predictions</h2>
      <p>In rare cases where unexpected behaviour results in the models not being able to generate a predictions we return
        the default recommendations.
        If there are no movies rated or the parameters passed are invalid or an unexpected error occurs the model will
        fallback to the default recommendations. The default predictions are simply the mean ratings of the movies by all users 
        in the dataset with a default popularity boost of 10.
